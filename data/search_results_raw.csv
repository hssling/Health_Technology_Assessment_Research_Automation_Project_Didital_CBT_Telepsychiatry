41176285,PET-measured tau deposition in emotion-related brain regions is differentially associated with depressive symptoms in individuals with versus without Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Depressive symptoms are common in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and can also precede AD as a risk factor and/or prodrome. Brain deposition of hyper-phosphorylated tau is a hallmark pathology of AD. Tau deposition in brain regions involved in emotional processing is likely to be pathophysiologically relevant to these links between AD and depression. We used 18F-MK6240 PET to measure tau in amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens-regions implicated in depression-in 141 participants with and without AD. In addition to tau PET, participants underwent amyloid-beta (Aβ) PET, MRI, and cognitive evaluation. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Multiple regression analyzed contributions of tau and Aβ status (positive vs. negative), depression (BDI > 13), cognition (impaired vs. normal), age and sex to tau burden in the three regions. A significant interaction between tau status and depression prompted subgroup analyses of tau-positive (n=34) and tau-negative (n=107) participants. Among tau-positive participants, depression was associated with greater tau in the nucleus accumbens, a region critical for reward processing and motivation. This finding suggests that tau-mediated accumbens dysfunction may contribute to anhedonia, a key symptom of depression that is particularly common in AD-related depression. In tau-negative participants, greater depression was associated with less tau in the medial temporal lobe. This unexpected finding requires confirmation through further research, but could reflect impaired neurogenesis in depression without AD pathology.",2025,Behavioural brain research,10.1016/j.bbr.2025.115889,Erika Glaubitz; Xiuyuan Hugh Wang; Ke Xi; Farnia Feiz; Silky Pahlajani; Tom Maloney; Emily Tanzi; Hani Hojjati; Liangong Zhou; Lidia Glodzik; Gloria Chiang; Yi Li; Ray Razlighi; Mony de Leon; Tracy Butler

41176084,"Innovation in the correction of pectus carinatum: A combination of orthopedic and surgical treatment (the ""3-Cs"" technique).","Pectus carinatum is a chest wall deformity characterized by a protrusion. For its correction, the flexibility of the chest wall is essential, as it will determine the possibility of correction through orthopedic or surgical treatment. Orthopedic treatment has experienced a boom in recent years thanks to the development of a dynamic compression system (vest) that applies pressure to the area. This effect can be limited by the rigidity of the chest wall (which increases with age) or by the presence of pronounced depressions of abnormally positioned cartilage (limiting cartilage). In these cases, we propose combining the use of the vest with limited partial chondrectomies to facilitate the vest's effect after this surgery. We have called this combination of vest-chondrectomy-vest the ""3-Cs"" technique.

41176080,Event-related potential correlates of visual processing across obsessive-compulsive and anxiety spectrum disorders: a scoping review.,"Humans rely on sensory input, particularly visual cues, to form continuous perceptual experiences, where visual processing-the ability to perceive, organize, and integrate visual cues-lays a crucial foundation for behavior. In obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders, symptoms are often prompted by visual cues, suggesting that sensory input may drive obsessive-compulsive and anxiety-related behaviors. In this scoping review, we synthesize 36 studies of the existing EEG/ERP literature assessing the extent and direction of visual processing dysfunction in response to both neutral and emotionally salient cues in the obsessive compulsive and anxiety (OCA) spectrum. Although there is a dearth of studies overall, those that exist suggest altered early visual processing in the OCAs, especially in obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. We explore how the rudimentary processing of visual cues may influence circuits that mediate fear, potentially contributing to obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms. Delineating the electrophysiological correlates of visual processing may contribute to a more nuanced understanding of brain disorders, informing future research and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",2025,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106446,Estelle Ayomen; Andreas Keil; Carol A Mathews

This exploratory study examined psychosocial and health-related correlates of subjective well-being (SWB), including life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect, among 287 TGNC individuals in Colombia. Using a multi-model inference approach to reach a likely consensus across more than 32,000 candidate models, we found that community cohesion, self-efficacy, and social support consistently related to higher life satisfaction and positive affect, while depression and disease burden were linked to lower SWB. Negative affect was positively associated with depression and age, and negatively with education. Although the sample was non-probabilistic and not representative of the broader TGNC population in Colombia, the prevalence of clinically significant depression and widespread discrimination were shocking. These findings are not intended as confirmatory but offer hypotheses about potential pathways through which individual and community factors may influence well-being in TGNC populations.",2025,Neuroscience,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.10.039,María Fernanda Reyes; Natalie Levy; Daniela Maldonado Salamanca; Minna Lyons; Juan-David Leongómez
41175897,Brain structural changes and their role in increasing depression risk following spinal cord injury: evidence from the UK biobank.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) markedly increases the risk of depression, affecting 16-30% of patients and contributing to elevated mortality. In this study, we used UK Biobank data to explore the relationship between SCI and depression, with a particular focus on structural brain changes as potential mediators. Cox regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, demonstrated that participants with SCI had a significantly higher incidence of depression than those without, with the effect more pronounced in women. Genetic predisposition further intensified the risk, with SCI associated with a 2.1-fold, 2.7-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in depression risk at low, medium, and high polygenic risk score levels, respectively. Neuroimaging analysis revealed cortical thinning in frontal areas, ventricular enlargement, and thalamic signal intensity changes, while mediation analysis indicated that brain structural alterations accounted for 6-9% of depression risk after SCI, particularly involving the right S. interm. prim. Jensen, left lateral ventricle, and thalamus. These findings underscore the complex interplay of structural brain changes, sex differences, and genetic susceptibility in mediating depression risk following SCI, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",2025,The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry,10.1080/15622975.2025.2576549,Wu Zhou; Bo Hei; Lei Huang; Jiayu Liu; Jixia Fang; Qun Gao; Bin Wang; Zihan Ding; Chengcai Li

41175714,Digital speech biomarkers for assessing cognitive decline across neurodegenerative conditions.,"This study investigates speech impairments in individuals with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), and Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), compared to healthy controls (HC), aiming to identify linguistic and acoustic digital biomarkers that differentiate these groups. Monologue recordings were collected from 68 HC, 42 MCI-AD, 50 MCI-LB, and 47 PD-MCI participants (ON state). Participants were instructed to speak spontaneously for one and a half minutes. Speech was automatically transcribed, manually corrected, and analyzed using natural language processing to extract eight linguistic (lexical/syntactic) and four acoustic (prosodic) biomarkers. Group differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, with Spearman's correlation used to examine associations with clinical and MRI measures (FDR-corrected). Machine learning models (XGBoost) were applied to evaluate the classificatory and predictive potential of speech features. Distinct speech patterns were observed across groups: MCI-AD participants exhibited reduced use of function words, resulting in increased content density, PD-MCI participants used shorter sentences and fewer coordinating conjunctions with longer pauses, and MCI-LB participants exhibited greater lexical repetition than MCI-AD. Altered speech features correlated with structural brain changes but not with global cognition (MoCA) or depressive symptoms (GDS). Sentence structure and pausing features showed strong interrelationships. Machine learning models showed that adding speech biomarkers improved classification performance compared to using clinical scores alone. In regression analyses, the models predicted MoCA with a normalized error of 10%, performing similarly on automatic and manually corrected transcripts. These findings suggest that speech biomarkers and traditional clinical assessments may offer complementary information about cognitive status and brain health, supporting their use in scalable, non-invasive cognitive monitoring.",2025,Computers in biology and medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.111251,Daniel Kovac; Lubomira Novakova; Jiri Mekyska; Krystof Novotny; Lubos Brabenec; Patricia Klobusiakova; Irena Rektorova
41175687,The impact of artificial intelligence impact awareness on college students' employment risk perception: A moderated mediation model.,"In the era of rapid technological transformation, college students are acutely aware of employment risks. This study primarily investigates the influence of awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence on college students' perception of employment risks. By conducting an empirical analysis of 1558 samples, a moderated mediation model is established to explore how the awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence affects college students' perception of employment risks. The findings reveal that the awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence has a positive correlation with college students' perception of employment risks. Employment anxiety serves as a mediator in the relationship between the awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence and college students' perception of employment risks. Moreover, learning goal orientation negatively moderates the effect of employment anxiety on college students' perception of employment risks. Specifically, learning goal orientation negatively moderates the mediating role of employment anxiety between the awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence and college students' perception of employment risks. These research results can assist organizations in formulating policies to intervene in college students' perception of employment risks arising from the awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of artificial - intelligence - related reforms.",2025,Acta psychologica,10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105808,Yanlong Liang; Yun Zhai

41175564,Social networks and depressive tendency: A longitudinal study from adolescence through adulthood.,"This study aimed to predict adult depressive tendencies based on adolescent developmental trajectories and social networks using longitudinal data from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP). Analyzing data from 1047 individuals across four waves (2000-2002 and 2017), we examined personal, family, and peer factors influencing depressive tendencies from adolescence to adulthood (age ∼30). Key findings indicate that high self-esteem, family cohesion, and peer support during adolescence are significant protective factors against adult depressive tendencies, while adverse family structures (e.g., divorced but cohabiting parents) increase risk. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, particularly GraphSAGE (F1-score = 0.3678), outperformed traditional machine learning methods (e.g., logistic regression, F1-score = 0.3509) by leveraging social network structures to enhance prediction accuracy, although the absolute F1-scores remain modest (∼0.37), reflecting the inherent challenges in predicting long-term depressive tendencies from psychosocial data. These results underscore the long-term impact of adolescent psychosocial factors and the superior capability of GNNs in modeling complex social interactions. Findings inform early intervention policies, advocating for school-based programs to foster self-esteem and social connections, and the integration of GNN-driven tools to identify at-risk individuals for targeted mental health support in Taiwan and similar cultural contexts.",2025,Journal of psychiatric research,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.10.064,Yu-Hsiu Lin; Wei-Cheng Huang; Jian-Jhih Kuo; Yu-Feng Hsu
41175563,Clinical patterns in a neuroimaging-based predictive model of self-reported dissociation.,"Assessment of trauma-related dissociation has been historically challenging given its subjective nature and the lack of provider education around this topic. Recent work identified a promising neural biomarker of trauma-related dissociation, representing a significant step toward improved assessment and identification of dissociation. However, it is necessary to better understand clinical factors that may be associated with this biomarker. Participants were 65 women with histories of childhood maltreatment, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varying levels of dissociation (e.g., co-occurring dissociative identity disorder, DID). Data were drawn from previously published work that identified a model predicting Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation severe pathological dissociation scores on the basis of neural functional connectivity. Here, we conducted a k-means cluster analysis to explore model performance patterns in the original prediction model. We then investigated differences among the clusters in a range of clinically-relevant variables. Our clustering analysis identified four distinct groups. The original model best predicted those at the low (cluster 1, 82 % PTSD) and high (cluster 3, 86 % DID) ends of self-reported dissociation. Cluster 2 also largely included participants with DID (67 %), but the predictive model was less accurate for these individuals. Follow up analyses revealed that DID participants in cluster 2 reported lower levels of self-state intrusions, a type of DID-specific dissociation, compared to those in cluster 3. Thus, the identified model performance patterns suggest that the original prediction model may be linked to DID-specific dissociation. Our findings indicate that patterns of functional connectivity may be valuable to improve accurate assessment of DID.",2025,Journal of psychiatric research,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.10.045,Juliann B Purcell; Boyu Ren; Cori A Palermo; Zoe A Bair; Mollie C Marr; Rebecca L Modell; Xi Pan; Matthew A Robinson; Meghan E Shanahan; Michaela B Swee; Milissa L Kaufman; Lauren A M Lebois

41175520,Sea salt associated microplastics amplify pathogenic Vibrio and impair development in brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana).,"Pathogens associated with microplastics in harvested sea salt could increase infection in inland mariculture. In the present study, two separate sets of tests: an in vitro test to examine the effects of microplastics on biofilm formation by Vibrio harveyi, and an in vivo test to evaluate the development of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) cultured using harvested sea salt. The experiment included four seawater treatments, differentiated by the presence of microplastics and autoclaving: microplastic-free seawater (MFSW), autoclaved microplastic-free seawater (AMFSW), autoclaved microplastic-containing seawater (AMCSW), and microplastic-containing seawater (MCSW). In vitro testing revealed that microplastics increased biofilm concentration and thickness by significantly inhibiting bacterial dispersion; while dispersion occurred multiple times in microplastic-free groups (MFSW, AMFSW), it was reduced to only one or two events in microplastic-containing groups (AMCSW, MCSW).

41175430,Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods and eating behaviors markers in university students.,"Brazilian university students face significant health challenges, with over one-third exceeding a healthy weight and Brazil experiencing the highest global prevalence of anxiety. We hypothesized that screening positive for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) would be associated with increased intake of ultra-processed foods (UPF) and unfavorable eating behaviors in this population. This cross-sectional study included 5,946 students (aged 18-59 years) from 94 Brazilian universities. GAD prevalence was assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), while dietary markers and eating behaviors were evaluated via the Brazilian Food and Nutrition Surveillance System tool. Our findings revealed a GAD prevalence of 42.3%. Students with GAD had higher consumption of hamburgers/processed meats (PR: 1.19; 95%CI: [1.10; 1.28]), sweetened beverages (PR: 1.12; 95%CI: [1.06; 1.18]), instant noodles/packaged snacks/savory biscuits (PR: 1.26; 95%CI: [1.13; 1.40]), and sandwich cookies/sweets/treats (PR: 1.14; 95%CI: [1.06; 1.22]), and lower consumption of vegetables (PR: 0.94; 95%CI: [0.90; 0.98]) compared to those without GAD. Additionally, those with GAD were more prone to eating in front of screens (PR: 1.07; 95%CI: [1.04; 1.10]), skipping breakfast (PR: 0.96; 95%CI: [0.93; 0.99]) and lunch (PR: 0.98; 95% CI: [0.98; 0.99]). In conclusion, GAD is probably associated with unhealthy eating behaviors in Brazilian university students.

41175418,Status epilepticus of carotid web after carotid artery stenting: A case report.,"Carotid web, a special vascular lesion, has been increasingly recognized as a significant etiology of ischemic stroke. Unlike traditional atherosclerosis, carotid web is a linear intraluminal protrusion with a free edge that oscillates with blood flow, leading to blood flow stagnation and thrombus formation. These pathophysiological features lead to the high risk of stroke recurrence and certain association with large-vessel occlusion. Given these, carotid artery revascularization has been recommended as an optional treatment for carotid web. We herein described a case of a patient with ischemic stroke and carotid web who eventually underwent carotid artery stenting after recurrent ischemic attacks during hospitalization. However, the patient developed status epilepticus postoperatively. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enlarged infarction, whose location was consistent with the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. Regarding therapy, intravenous infusion of sodium valproate successfully terminated the status epilepticus secondary to stroke, providing an alternative when clinicians are concerned about the depression of diazepam. Subsequent oral antiseizure medications were required and newer-generation agents (e.g. levetiracetam, lacosamide, zonisamide, and topiramate) were increasingly recommended due to their neutral impact on secondary stroke prevention.",2025,The Journal of international medical research,10.1177/03000605251386171,Xiao-Jun Jing; Ling Yan; Hai-Zhen Hao; Bo Long; Peng-Cheng Wu; Jiao Wang; Xiao Yuan; Yong Tan; Xun-Jun Li

41175308,Functional disability screening in the elderly: a machine learning approach with ELSI-Brazil data.,"The aim of this study was to investigate, validate and apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict functional disability in elderly individuals using data from ELSI-Brazil. Furthermore, it sought to map the performance of the models and identify key multidimensional variables-encompassing sociodemographic and economic aspects, health status, behaviors, mental health and access to services-that could serve as early risk indicators and, based on the selected model, understand which characteristics favor or disfavor the screening of functional disability. Data from ELSI-Brazil (2015-2016) with 4502 participants were analyzed, after careful selection and pre-processing, which included imputing missing data, standardization and encoding via one-hot encoder. The selection of 49 predictor variables, from sociodemographic, health and behavioral domains, enabled the development of classification models. The SMOTE technique and tenfold cross-validation, associated with Bayesian optimization, were applied. The interpretability of the selected model was performed through SHAP analysis. The Ridge Classifier model showed robust performance, with a ROC-AUC of 0.785 (95% CI: 0.756-0.813), sensitivity of 0.703 and specificity of 0.723, in addition to a high negative predictive value (84.5%). SHAP analysis showed that variables such as depressive symptoms, concern about mobility and self-rated health status were decisive in classifying the functional disability risk. The results suggest that the use of ML techniques, integrated with multidimensional health data commonly collected in primary care settings, offers a promising tool for screening and early intervention in functional disability in the elderly. This approach may substantiate decision-making in clinical practice and health support policies aimed at active and healthy aging.",2025,GeroScience,10.1007/s11357-025-01951-9,Dalton Breno Costa; Carmen Moret-Tatay; João Carlos Néto; Tatiana Quarti Irigaray
41175300,Remimazolam tosilate combined with remifentanil hydrochloride alleviates dental phobia in patients undergoing tooth extraction surgeries.,"Extraction surgery often induces anxiety and fear in patients with dental phobia. Traditional sedation protocols have limitations such as insufficient depth of sedation and incomplete analgesia. Remimazolam tosilate (RT) and remifentanil hydrochloride (RH), as novel sedative-analgesic agents, have pharmacokinetic advantages of rapid onset, short duration of action, and no accumulation, and may be more suitable for the management of phobia during extraction surgery. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of RT combined with RH in alleviating phobia in patients undergoing extraction and its clinical safety. A total of 262 patients undergoing complex extraction surgery were assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 131) and the control group (CG, n = 131). The EG was administered an individualized regimen of RT + RH, while the CG received propofol intravenous sedation. The level of fear was assessed using the dental anxiety scale (DAS, with a score range of 11-55, ≥31 indicates severe anxiety). Sedation depth (Ramsay score), visual analogue scale (VAS), vital signs, and adverse events were monitored concurrently. Patient satisfaction was also recorded (on a scale of 0-10, with ≥7 indicating satisfaction). The DAS score of the EG was significantly lower than that of the CG after surgery (12.3 ± 3.2 vs 22.5 ± 4.7, P < 0.05). The VAS pain score (1.23 ± 0.45 vs 3.48 ± 1.21, P < 0.05) and pharyngeal reflex score (1.8 ± 0.6 vs 3.5 ± 0.9, P < 0.05) of the EG were also significantly better than those of the CG. The patient satisfaction score of the EG (9.12 ± 0.89) was significantly higher than that of the CG (7.23 ± 1.45) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the postoperative systolic blood pressure (122.3 ± 10.5 vs 135.6 ± 12.3 mmHg), heart rate (72.5 ± 8.3 vs 85.6 ± 9.7 beats/min), and other vital signs of the EG were more stable, and the incidence of angina (0.76% vs 2.29%) and hypertension (1.53% vs 3.82%) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The combination of RT and RH can effectively alleviate dental phobia in patients undergoing extraction, enhance the effects of sedation and analgesia as well as patient comfort, and has good safety, which is worthy of clinical application and promotion.",2025,Odontology,10.1007/s10266-025-01239-6,Chen Cao; Huiyu Yan; Chan Cheng; Lu Li; Kaixuan Wang; Chen Wang; Chuxiong Pan

To evaluate the impact of HIV-related stigma on the quality of life among PHIV in Dar es Salaam, we conducted a qualitative study between December 2021 and June 2022. We enrolled participants in the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study who were from the Ilala Municipality of Dar es Salaam. Using a semi-structured discussion guide, three focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the 33 participants. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. The impact of stigma on quality of life was grouped into three themes: (1) health impact manifested as failure to attend clinic as scheduled, poor adherence to medication and appetite and weight loss; (2) psychosocial impact manifested as fear, stress, depression, family instability, limited social interaction and a difficult learning environment and (3) economic impact manifested as denied employment opportunities, loss of job, denied financial support and a lack of economic support. PHIV experience stigma, which affects their economic status, health and well-being. Therefore, strengthening programmes, such as community education, awareness campaigns, peer support groups among PHIV and the establishment of microeconomic groups for PHIV may reduce stigma and improve quality of life.",2025,AIDS care,10.1080/09540121.2025.2581203,Godfrey L Sambayi; George Msema Bwire; Mary Spicar Kilapilo; David T Myemba; Idda H Mosha; Manase Kilonzi; Maryam Amour; Rogers Mwakalukwa; Ally Mangara; Muhammad Bakari; Christopher R Sudfeld; Mecky I N Matee; Raphael Z Sangeda; Lisa V Adams; Japhet Killewo
