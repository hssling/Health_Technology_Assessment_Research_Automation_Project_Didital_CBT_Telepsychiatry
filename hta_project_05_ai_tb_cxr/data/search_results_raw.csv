41176289,Comparison of diagnostic efficacy of three different oral samples in pulmonary tuberculosis using cepheid gene Xpert® MTB/RIF ultra.,"The etiological confirmation of pulmonary tuberculosis typically relies on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Oral sampling offers a non-invasive and non-sputum alternative, but evidence varies widely due to inconsistent methods. This study employed the Cepheid Gene Xpert® MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert-Ultra) to compare the diagnostic performance of tongue swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POS) collected from the same patient to identify the optimal option.",2025,Journal of microbiological methods,10.1016/j.mimet.2025.107310,Yan Liu; Qianfang Hu; Shuliang Guo

41173931,Development and application of a deep learning-based tuberculosis diagnostic assistance system in remote areas of Northwest China.,"The Kashgar region, located in Northwest China, has a significantly higher incidence of tuberculosis (TB) compared to the national average. Local governments conduct annual TB screening using medical imaging. However, due to a shortage of radiologists, insufficient diagnostic capabilities, low levels of informatization, and reliance on manual processes in primary healthcare institutions, traditional medical imaging methods for TB screening suffer from low efficiency, high rates of misdiagnosis, and missed diagnoses. To develop a deep learning-based TB diagnostic assistance system tailored to local conditions, addressing the shortcomings of primary healthcare institutions, improving TB screening efficiency, and reducing misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates. We collected chest X-ray images from 10,897 patients across multiple centers, with 10,002 cases used for training and 895 cases for testing. We trained a TB-UNET model and developed a TB diagnostic assistance system based on this model, deploying it in 12 counties and 178 township hospitals in the Kashgar region. The system enhanced the informatization of primary healthcare institutions. In clinical testing, Radiologists' sensitivity in diagnosing TB increased by 11.8% (from 62.7% [95% CI 58.2-67.1%] to 74.5% [95% CI 70.3-78.4%], p < 0.001), accuracy improved by 2.8% (from 87.2% [95% CI 85.1-89.1%] to 90.0% [95% CI 88.2-91.6%], p = 0.023), and the average time spent on reading images decreased from 38.83 s (95% CI 36.21-41.45 s) to 15.93 s (95% CI 14.32-17.54 s, p < 0.001). The system significantly enhanced TB screening efficiency in the Kashgar region, reducing misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates. It has high practical value and offers a replicable model for screening other infectious diseases in remote areas.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-22037-8,Pahatijiang Nijiati; Saimaitikari Abudoubari; Yimin Zimin; Abudouresuli Tuersun

41170421,,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a persistent global public health challenge, with the rise of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) complicating all the disease control efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated for molecular diagnostic techniques, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to enhance TB diagnosis and treatment strategies. In this study, we performed WGS analysis on 49 pulmonary tuberculosis isolates from Mexican patients to identify mutations conferring resistance to 11 key antimicrobial agents: four first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) and 7 second line drugs (fluoroquinolones, ethionamide/prothionamide, amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, streptomycin, and bedaquiline). We identified 89 novel variants: 48 in genes previously associated with drug resistance and 41 in genes not previously linked to resistance mechanisms, including potential novel mutations associated with delamanid resistance. Additionally, we detected 31 mutations across three efflux pump superfamilies (ABC, RND, and MFS); all of these variants warrant further investigation regarding their contribution to antibiotic resistance. This analysis represents approximately 10% of Mexico's national variant registry, providing substantial insight into the molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis within the country. The identification of new resistance-associated variants (RAV) from clinical isolates underrepresented in global databases, contributes to develop improved diagnostic tools, optimize treatment regimens, and probably to elucidate antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Specifically, the identification of RAVs for new drugs like bedaquiline, pretomanid, delamanid, and linezolid, which are central to the most recent schemes of treatment (BPaLM, BPaL, BDLLfxC, BLMZ), is key to the improvement of patient outcomes and preventing the emergence of resistance to these critical therapeutic options.",2025,Frontiers in microbiology,10.3389/fmicb.2025.1666838,Néstor Alvarado-Peña; Marcela Muñoz Torrico; Luis Narváez-Díaz; Paulina M Mejía-Ponce; Eduardo Becerril Vargas; Joaquín Zúñiga; Raquel Muñiz-Salazar; Rafael Laniado-Laborín; Cuauhtémoc Licona-Cassani; Xavier Soberón; Eugenia Silva-Herzog

41168391,Diagnostic assistance method for RR-TB/MDR-TB patients under treatment based on CNN-LSTM.,"The rapid development of deep learning has promoted its application in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the management of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB/MDR-TB). In particular, chest computed tomography (CT) scans offer detailed lung images that can reveal subtle features. In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to predict treatment outcomes in RR-TB/MDR-TB patients, aiming to support clinicians in timely adjustment of therapeutic strategies and improving treatment success. The model integrates CNN for image feature extraction with LSTM for sequential analysis of patient monitoring data, including two types of immune detection indicators (T-cell subsets and peripheral blood tuberculosis-related CD161-positive cells). Transfer learning with weight initialization was applied to enhance model performance, and three backbone architectures (DenseNet201 + ABC, ResNet-50 + ABC, CheXNet + ABC) were compared to assess their impact on predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated that the CNN-LSTM model with DenseNet201 + ABC as the backbone achieved the highest accuracy in predicting subsequent treatment indicators. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using CNN-LSTM for treatment outcome prediction in RR-TB/MDR-TB, and highlighted its potential to assist clinicians in precision-tailoring treatment plans, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and offering both theoretical and practical value in healthcare.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-21955-x,Jie Li; Wenqing Wu; Zhixiong Fang; Pinxiang Fu; Hua Huang; Yanhong Zhou; Liang Yu; He Huang; Tao Wang; Qilong Zhang

41162950,Cost-effectiveness of preventive treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection among key community-level populations.,"Expanding tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) for high-risk populations with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a key component of the End TB Strategy. However, the high-risk population size is small, which may have limited impact on reducing TB incidence. We aimed to evaluate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of expanding TPT to key community-level population METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model incorporating the effect of TPT and seasonal variations in TB incidence. The model was calibrated by monthly pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) case data during 2011-2018 from Shaanxi province, China, and validated by data in 2019. We first assessed the TB epidemic trend for seven expanding TPT strategies and sought the optimal TPT strategy that can reach the target of the End TB Strategy by 2035. Then, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of this optimal TPT strategy with five TPT regimens (isoniazid monotherapy with two different durations, rifampin monotherapy, and combinations of isoniazid with rifampin or rifapentine) over 2025-2050, compared with no TPT, from a health system perspective.

41150671,Early cost-effectiveness analysis of a novel rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis in rural Philippine settings.,"Tuberculosis disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where gold standard molecular diagnostic assays like Xpert MTB/RIF are relatively frequently inaccessible. A novel rapid molecular diagnostic test (nLRDT), which can test tongue swab samples, and is more suitable for decentralised primary healthcare settings, has been developed and is currently undergoing preclinical validation. This study evaluated the early cost-effectiveness of this nLRDT vs. Xpert MTB/RIF for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in rural Philippine primary healthcare settings. A hybrid decision tree and Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from health provider and societal perspectives. Parameters were taken from relevant literature, national-level data, and expert opinion. Costs were expressed in 2024 US dollars and cost-effectiveness evaluated by comparing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with willingness-to-pay threshold estimates. An estimated willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $1,357 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used. The nLRDT was cost-effective with sputum samples, from both perspectives, with net monetary benefits (NMBs) of $26.62 (societal perspective) and $19.21 (provider perspective) at the WTP threshold of $1,357. Similarly, the nLRDT was estimated to be cost-effective for tongue swab samples from both perspectives, with NMBs of $43.81 (societal) and $24.79 (provider). Sensitivity and scenario analyses identified the specificity of nLRDT as the key driver of cost-effectiveness, with cost-effectiveness maintained at greater WTP thresholds and varying combinations of test performance characteristics. Our findings suggest the nLRDT can be a cost-effective diagnostic tool in rural Philippines, and possibly other similar, contexts.

41145423,Multi-view deep learning framework for the detection of chest X-rays compatible with pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health burden, particularly in low-resource, high-prevalence regions. Pediatric TB diagnosis poses challenges with non-specific symptoms and less distinct radiological manifestations than adult TB. Many affected children remain undiagnosed or untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends chest X-ray (CXR) for TB screening and triage, given its accessibility and rapid assessment of pulmonary TB-related abnormalities. We present pTBLightNet, a multi-view deep learning framework to detect pediatric pulmonary TB by identifying TB-compatible CXRs with consistent radiological findings. Leveraging both frontal and lateral CXR views, our framework is pre-trained on adult CXR datasets (N = 114,173), then fine-tuned or trained from scratch, and subsequently evaluated on CXR datasets (N = 918) from three pediatric TB cohorts. It achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.903 and 0.682 on internal and external testing, respectively. External evaluation supports its effectiveness and generalizability using CXR TB compatibility, expert reading, microbiological confirmation and case definition as reference standards. Age-specific models (<5 and 5-18 years) perform competitively with those trained on larger undifferentiated populations, and adding lateral CXRs improves diagnosis in younger children. These results highlight the robustness of our approach across age groups and its potential to improve TB diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.",2025,Nature communications,10.1038/s41467-025-64391-1,Daniel Capellán-Martín; Juan J Gómez-Valverde; Ramón Sánchez-Jacob; Alicia Hernanz-Lobo; H Simon Schaaf; Lara García-Delgado; Orvalho Augusto; Pooneh Roshanitabrizi; Alberto L García-Basteiro; Jose Luis Ribó; Ángel Lancharro; Antoni Noguera-Julian; Daniel Blázquez-Gamero; Marius George Linguraru; Begoña Santiago-García; Elisa López-Varela; María J Ledesma-Carbayo

The pooled sensitivity was 49% (range: 3% to 92%), indicating a risk of false negatives, and its pooled specificity was 86% (range: 31% to 98%), reflecting good performance in ruling out non-TB cases. Sensitivity was moderate in HIV (60%) and HCWs (55%), low in TB contacts (48%), children (43%), and RA (39%), and lowest in IBD (15%). Specificity was highest in IBD (94%), children (91%), HCWs (84%), RA (82%), TB contacts (80%), and moderate in HIV (74%). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 61% (range: 5% to 97%) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 72% (range:13% to 98%). PPV was moderate in TB contacts (70%), RA (64%), HCWs (63%), HIV (51%), children (50%), and low in IBD (42%), and NPV was high in children (88%), HIV (84%), IBD (79%), HCWs (73%), RA (72%), and moderate in TB contacts (63%), with substantial heterogeneity across populations. Despite high specificity, the lower sensitivity suggests QFT tests may miss some latent TB infections. The diagnostic odds ratio was 5.73 (SE ± 1), indicating strong yet highly variable performance (I² = 96.2%). This highlighted the need to combine QFT tests with other diagnostics. QFT tests had high specificity and NPV, ensuring reliable negative results. However, lower sensitivity reduces PPV, making positive results less definitive. The results also revealed moderate sensitivity in HIV, lowest in IBD, highest specificity in IBD, lowest in HIV, highlighting heterogeneous performances.",2025,Immunologic research,10.1007/s12026-025-09714-6,Jelkeba Bali Weyesa; Mengistu Legesse; Balako Gumi; Girmay Medhin; Ketema Tolossa; Aboma Zewude; Gobena Ameni

41137309,Role of social support in the relationship between health empowerment and quality of life among elderly pulmonary tuberculosis patients in mainland China: A moderation study.,"This study investigates the moderating role of social support in the relationship between health empowerment and quality of life among elderly pulmonary tuberculosis patients in mainland China, utilizing the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique to identify the specific conditions under which this moderation occurs. A convenience sampling approach was employed to recruit 451 elderly pulmonary tuberculosis patients from the Department of Tuberculosis at Anhui Chest Hospital. Data collection took place between June 2023 and December 2023. Key variables were measured using established instruments: the health empowerment scale, the perceived social support scale, and the SF-36 quality of life scale. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation to assess relationships between variables and J-N moderation analysis to explore the moderating effect of social support. Positive correlations were found between both health empowerment and social support with patients' total quality of life, physical component scores, and mental component scores. The J-N moderation analysis revealed a significant, non-linear moderating effect of social support on the relationship between health empowerment and quality of life. Specifically, at lower levels of social support, health empowerment demonstrated a positive association with quality of life. However, as social support levels increased, this positive relationship weakened. Furthermore, at high levels of social support, the relationship between health empowerment and quality of life turned negative, suggesting that excessive social support might mitigate the beneficial impact of health empowerment. Social support plays a complex and crucial non-linear moderating role in the relationship between health empowerment and quality of life among elderly pulmonary tuberculosis patients. While beneficial at moderate levels, excessive social support can paradoxically diminish the positive effects of health empowerment on quality of life. These results highlight the necessity of designing personalized and balanced intervention strategies that not only foster patient empowerment but also provide an optimal, rather than overwhelming, level of social support to maximize the quality of life for elderly pulmonary tuberculosis patients.",2025,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000045247,Zhuxing Deng; Huiping Xiao; Jingfang Hong
41137226,Potential targets and mechanisms of Yangyin Quyu decoction against pulmonary tuberculosis: A network pharmacology and molecular docking study.,"This study aims to investigate the potential active ingredients, targets, and signaling pathways of Yangyin Quyu decoction (YYQYD) for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. In this study, we constructed an ""ingredient-disease"" target library utilizing TCMSP, UniProt, GeneCards, OMIM, and SangerBox. We developed a protein interaction network for YYQYD in the treatment of PTB using Cytoscape 3.10.2 software. Additionally, we employed SangerBox and Wei Sheng Xin to conduct Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and to build the ""component-pathway-target"" network. Furthermore, we utilized molecular docking technology to visualize the active ingredients of YYQYD alongside the core targets of PTB. In this study, we screened quercetin, γ-aminobutyric acid, luteolin, kaempferol, and formononetin, identifying TP53, STAT3, AKT1, JUN, and ESR1 as the key targets of the decoction. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways showed the mechanisms mainly involved multiple signaling pathways (e.g., pathways in cancer, P = 4.90 × 10-29; metabolic pathways, P = 1.15 × 10-5). Furthermore, molecular docking results indicated that the active components exhibited significant binding affinities with the core targets of PTB. Quercetin and kaempferol, both with a binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol for STAT3 and ESR1 respectively, demonstrated excellent binding capabilities. Luteolin also showed strong binding to STAT3 with a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol. Formononetin exhibited certain binding capabilities across various targets, while γ-aminobutyric acid displayed moderate binding affinities, suggesting potential synergistic roles within the biological context. This study proposed that the intricate network pharmacological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of YYQYD in the treatment of PTB. This research provides a molecular foundation for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies and proposes a targeted intervention strategy that aligns with the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine.",2025,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000045291,Chen-Yang Liu; Jie Shen; Yun-Ting Xue; Meng Li

41133157,A novel circulating miRNA panel for early differential diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from lung cancer with similar radiographic presentations.,"This study aimed to establish a novel diagnostic approach based on a circulating microRNA (miRNA) panel to reliably distinguish pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from lung cancer (LC), particularly in patients presenting with overlapping radiographic features. A total of 592 participants were enrolled. In the discovery phase, miRNA expression profiles from 284 individuals, including PTB patients, LC patients, and healthy controls (HC), were analyzed to screen potential biomarkers. Candidate miRNAs were subsequently validated in an independent cohort of 308 plasma samples. The analysis revealed significant upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p, hsa-miR-199a-3p, and hsa-miR-199b-3p in PTB compared with LC. A diagnostic panel incorporating these three miRNAs demonstrated robust performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.911 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.852-0.952) in the training set and 0.886 (95% CI: 0.780-0.953) in the validation set, with a sensitivity of 0.879. This miRNA panel outperformed the World Health Organization -endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF assay, effectively identifying early-stage PTB cases without cavity formation. These findings underscore the potential of miRNA-based diagnostics as a non-invasive and highly accurate tool for differentiating PTB from LC in patients with comparable imaging presentations, addressing a critical gap in pulmonary disease management.",2025,Frontiers in medicine,10.3389/fmed.2025.1660291,Xiao Liu; Wentao Wang; Yurong Fu; Zhengjun Yi
